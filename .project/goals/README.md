# Goals - 2nd Problem

Since this project is a project-based learning project, there are some weekly goals to follow and accomplish 
according to what have been discussed on the previous discussion session.

There are two kind of goals, development - to implement something physical on the labs - and 
session - to implement strategies for the next session to discuss.

Some (most) of them are not included here, but internally on the source code of the project.

## All Goals

### Week 1

**Development**

* Create a simple publisher-subscriber proof of concept using Docker.

See [`pubsub`](./pubsub/README.md)

**Session**

* Study Byzantine Generals Problem, consensus and fault tolerance.
